This file is for explaining linux commands:
First of all understand that there are two types of users in linux
one a general user with certain permissions second root which has the divine power in the machine 
so to aquire root privilege use sudo command 
so starting with basic commands 
ls -lists all the file and dir in the particular working directory
pwd- prints working directory
cd -changes directory
now cd has multiple different combinations
cd - this will take you to home dir
cd .. - goes to one step back 
many more ...
there are two types of paths relative path and direct path
for example if lets say you are in /var/www/html and in that html path there is a file index.html
so in direct path you need to be in /var/www/html and then type ls to know about this file 
and in relative path you can enter ls then /var/www/html/ this will give all the files in that path
